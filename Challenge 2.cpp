/* Calculate Student's Total Marks
Write a C++ class called student with

private member variables:

name(string type)

mark1 and mark2 (float type)

And member functions:

Get_Marks(int marknumber), a function which should return mark1 if marknumber equals 1 and mark2 otherwise.

calc_total() function should take the two marks entered and return their sum.

Also define two constructors:

A default constructor that takes no parameters and initializes the values to zeros and null.
A constructor that takes the three variables and sets them to given values.
Input#
Name of student, marks in first and second test

Output#
Sum of both marks */
