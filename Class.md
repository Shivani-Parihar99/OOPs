# Custom Objects
In C++, we have several different data types like int, string, bool etc. An object can be created out of any of those types. An object is an instance of a class. 
Well, object-oriented programming wouldn’t make sense if we couldn’t make our own custom objects. This is where classes come into play.
Classes are used to create user-defined data types. The predefined data types in C++ are classes themselves. We can use these basic data types to create our own class. The cool part is that our class can contain multiple variables, pointers, and functions which would be available to us whenever a class object is created.

Let’s start off with an example of a car class. Below, we can see the attributes that a car object would contain:
