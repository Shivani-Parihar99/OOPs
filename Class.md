# Custom Objects
In C++, we have several different data types like int, string, bool etc. An object can be created out of any of those types. An object is an instance of a class. 
Well, object-oriented programming wouldn’t make sense if we couldn’t make our own custom objects. This is where classes come into play.
Classes are used to create user-defined data types. The predefined data types in C++ are classes themselves. We can use these basic data types to create our own class. The cool part is that our class can contain multiple variables, pointers, and functions which would be available to us whenever a class object is created.

# Data Members
These are also known as the member variables of a class. This is because they contain the information relevant to the object of the class.
A car object would have a top speed, the number of seats it has, and so many other pieces of data that we could store in variables.

# Member Functions#
This category of attributes enables the class object to perform operations using the member variables. In the case of the car class, the Refuel() function would fill up the FuelTank property of the object.

# Benefits of Using Classes#
The concept of classes allows us to create complex objects and applications in C++. This is why classes are the basic building blocks behind all of the OOP’s principles.

Classes are also very useful in compartmentalizing the code of an application. Different components could become separate classes which would interact through interfaces. These ready-made components will also be available for use in future applications.

The use of classes makes it easier to maintain the different parts of an application since it is easier to make changes in classes.
