Data hiding is an essential process in the OOP cycle.
In layman’s terms, data hiding refers to the concept of hiding the inner workings of a class and simply providing an interface through which the outside world can interact with the class without knowing what’s going on inside.

Our goal is to make the interaction between different classes as simple as possible. This can only be achieved if the interfaces of the classes are simple. One class does not need to know anything about the underlying algorithms of another class. However, the two can still communicate.
