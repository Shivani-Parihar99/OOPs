/* Implement a Calculator Class
Write a C++ class called Calculator with

private member variables:

num1 and num2 (float type)
And member functions:

add(float n1, float n2), a function which returns the addition of two numbers

Subtract(float n1, float n2), a function which returns the subtraction of n1 from n2

multiply(float n1, float n2), a function which returns the multiplication of numbers

divide(float n1, float n2), a function which returns the division of n2 by n1

Define a default constructor which initializes both numbers by zeros

Input#
Pass floating point numbers in the member functions

Output#
Addition, Subtraction, division, and multiplication */
