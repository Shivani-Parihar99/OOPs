# What is a Constructor?
As the name suggests, the constructor is used to construct the object of a class. It is a special member function that outlines the steps that are performed when an instance of a class is created in the program.
A constructor’s name must be exactly the same as the name of its class.
The constructor is a special function because it does not have a return type. We do not even need to write void as the return type. It is a good practice to declare/define it as the first member function.
So, let’s study the different types of constructors and use them to create class objects.
