# What is a Destructor?
A destructor is the opposite of a constructor. It is called when the object of a class is no longer in use. The object is destroyed and the memory it occupied is now free for future use.

C++ does not have transparent garbage collection like Java. Hence, in order to efficiently free memory, we must specify our own destructor for a class.

In this destructor, we can specify the additional operations which need to be performed when a class object is deleted.

A class destructor can be created in a similar way to the constructor, except that the destructor is preceded by the ~ keyword.

# Explicit Garbage Collection
A small degree of garbage collection can be easily achieved through smart pointers. A smart pointer, the shared_ptr in particular, keeps a reference count for the object it points. When the counter comes down to 0, the object is deleted.

It’s time to make a destructor and see how it behaves.

# Destroying Objects is Important
If we don’t deallocate the memory for the objects which are not in use, we will end up with memory leaks and no space for our application to work long term.
